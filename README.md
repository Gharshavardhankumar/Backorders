# Problem Statement:
Is to identify products at risk of backorder before the event occurs so that business has time to react.
# what is a Backorder?
* Backorders are products that are temporarily out of stock, but a customer is permitted to place an order against future inventory.
A backorder generally indicates that customer demand for a product or service exceeds a companyâ€™s capacity to supply it.
Back orders are both good and bad. Strong demand can drive back orders, but so can suboptimal planning.
